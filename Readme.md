# Flight Fare Prediction

## Overview
This project is focused on predicting flight fares using the Random Forest Regressor machine learning algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features such as departure and arrival locations, date, and other relevant factors affecting flight fares.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Flask (for web application)
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk (for deployment)

## Data Source
The dataset used for training the model is sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh). Ensure that you have the required dataset before running the code.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fahad87667/Flight-Fare-Prediction
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the app

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Random Forest Regressor
The Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm used for predicting numerical values. In this project, it is employed to predict flight fares based on input features.

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment
The model is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for scalable and reliable hosting. Follow the AWS Elastic Beanstalk documentation for deployment instructions.
